# Project Progress: Ableton Documentation Assistant

## What Works
- PDF document loading and processing
- Text chunking and embedding generation
- ChromaDB vector store setup and querying
- LocalAI integration with GPT-4o model
- Conversational chat interface
- Markdown rendering of responses
- Dark/light mode UI
- PDF document display with source context
- ChromaDB initialization and server management
- Python 3.10 environment for ChromaDB compatibility

## What's Left to Build
- Incremental vector store updates
- Response caching mechanism
- Advanced filtering options
- User preference saving
- Multi-document support improvements
- Visualization of vector relationships
- Integration with more Ableton resources

## Current Status
The application is functional with a complete end-to-end flow. Users can ask questions about Ableton Live and receive accurate, formatted responses with source context. The technology stack has been successfully upgraded from Ollama/Mistral to LocalAI with GPT-4o, and from HNSWLib to ChromaDB for vector storage.

Recent development has focused on resolving compatibility issues between Python versions and ChromaDB. We've established that Python 3.10 is specifically required for ChromaDB to function properly, and have created a dedicated chromadb_venv environment to ensure stable operation.

## Known Issues
- ChromaDB requires specifically Python 3.10 and fails silently with newer versions like Python 3.13
- LocalAI embedding generation requires specific model name "text-embedding-ada-002" for compatibility
- Initial PDF processing can take significant time for large documents
- No progress persistence if initialization is interrupted
- ChromaDB server needs to be started separately before application usage
- LocalAI server needs to be running with correct models loaded
- No automatic migration path from HNSWLib to ChromaDB vectors

## Recent Accomplishments
- Successfully identified and resolved Python version compatibility issues with ChromaDB
- Fixed embedding authentication errors with LocalAI by updating configuration
- Created dedicated Python 3.10 virtual environment for ChromaDB compatibility
- Updated start-chromadb.sh script to use the correct virtual environment
- Successfully tested ChromaDB server startup and operation
- Streamlined development workflow with better error handling and logging
- Updated documentation to reflect Python version requirements

## Next Development Phase
The next development phase will focus on enhancing the user experience and improving the robustness of the application. Key areas include:

1. **Reliability Improvements**:
   - Better error handling for services not running
   - Automatic retry mechanisms for failed operations
   - Validation of environment setup

2. **User Experience Enhancements**:
   - Improved context display
   - Response quality metrics
   - Better loading states

3. **Architecture Refinements**:
   - Service orchestration improvements
   - Cache management
   - Resource optimization

4. **Documentation and Onboarding**:
   - Comprehensive setup guide with Python version requirements
   - Troubleshooting guide for common issues
   - User guide with example queries
