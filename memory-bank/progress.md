# Project Progress: Ableton Documentation Assistant

## What Works
- PDF document loading and processing
- Text chunking and embedding generation
- ChromaDB vector store setup and querying
- LocalAI integration with GPT-4o model
- Conversational chat interface
- Markdown rendering of responses
- Dark/light mode UI
- PDF document display with source context
- ChromaDB initialization and server management using dedicated `chroma run` command
- Python 3.10 environment for ChromaDB compatibility
- ChromaDB heartbeat verification using API v2 endpoints
- LocalAI with GPU acceleration when hardware supports it
- Updated README with comprehensive setup instructions

## What's Left to Build
- Incremental vector store updates
- Response caching mechanism
- Advanced filtering options
- User preference saving
- Multi-document support improvements
- Visualization of vector relationships
- Integration with more Ableton resources

## Current Status
The application is functional with a complete end-to-end flow. Users can ask questions about Ableton Live and receive accurate, formatted responses with source context. The technology stack has been successfully upgraded from Ollama/Mistral to LocalAI with GPT-4o, and from HNSWLib to ChromaDB for vector storage.

Recent development has focused on resolving compatibility issues between Python versions and ChromaDB. We've established that Python 3.10 is specifically required for ChromaDB to function properly, and have created a dedicated chromadb_venv environment to ensure stable operation. Additionally, we've discovered that ChromaDB 1.0.7 requires using the dedicated `chroma run` command-line tool rather than attempting to run the server via Python modules directly.

Further improvements include fixing the ChromaDB server heartbeat check by switching from API v1 to API v2 endpoints, and configuring LocalAI to use GPU acceleration for better performance when compatible hardware is available. We have also thoroughly updated the README to reflect all these changes and provide clear setup instructions for users.

## Known Issues
- ChromaDB requires specifically Python 3.10 and fails silently with newer versions like Python 3.13
- ChromaDB 1.0.7 server must be started using the `chroma run` command and not via `python -m chromadb.app`
- ChromaDB server heartbeat check requires using API v2 endpoint instead of deprecated v1 route
- LocalAI embedding generation requires specific model name "text-embedding-3-small" for compatibility
- LocalAI GPU acceleration requires properly configured CUDA or Metal support based on hardware
- Initial PDF processing can take significant time for large documents
- No progress persistence if initialization is interrupted
- ChromaDB server needs to be started separately before application usage
- LocalAI server needs to be running with correct models loaded
- No automatic migration path from HNSWLib to ChromaDB vectors

## Recent Accomplishments
