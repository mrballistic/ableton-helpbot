## Current Status

### Project State: **Functional Prototype**

The Ableton Documentation Assistant is currently in a functional prototype state. It successfully processes PDF documentation, creates a vector store, and can answer questions about Ableton Live based on the documentation. The user interface provides a clean chat experience with proper formatting and accessibility features.

### Key Metrics
- **Initialization Time**: ~30-60 minutes for first run (PDF processing)
- **Startup Time**: ~5-10 seconds for subsequent runs
- **Response Time**: ~2-5 seconds per query
- **Memory Usage**: Peak of ~1-2GB during initialization, ~500MB during operation
- **Test Coverage**: ~50% of codebase

### Known Issues
1. **Memory Spikes**: Large memory usage during initial PDF processing
2. **Slow Initialization**: First-time setup can take a long time
3. **Context Limitations**: Sometimes misses relevant context for complex questions
4. **Error Handling**: Limited recovery options for certain failure scenarios
5. **UI Responsiveness**: Some lag during intensive processing operations

### Recent Progress
- Implemented parallel processing with worker threads
- Added real-time initialization progress tracking
- Enhanced user interface with accessibility features
- Implemented error handling for common failure scenarios
- Added dark/light mode support

### Next Milestone: **Robust Production Version**
The next major milestone is to transition from a functional prototype to a robust production version with improved error handling, performance optimizations, and enhanced user experience features.

## Testing Status
- ✅ Basic component tests
- ✅ Server endpoint tests
- ✅ Error handling tests
- ✅ Accessibility tests
- ❓ Performance testing (partial)
- ❌ End-to-end integration testing
- ❌ Stress testing

## Deployment Status
Currently running locally in development mode. No production deployment has been set up yet.
