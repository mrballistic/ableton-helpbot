# Active Context: Ableton Documentation Assistant

## Current Work Focus
The project is currently focused on establishing a stable foundation for the Ableton Documentation Assistant. The core functionality of PDF processing, vector embedding, and question-answering is operational. Recent work has been concentrated on improving the user interface, accessibility features, and error handling.

## Recent Changes
- Implemented accessibility features for screen reader support
- Added dark/light mode based on system preferences
- Created initialization modal with progress reporting
- Optimized PDF processing with worker threads for parallel processing
- Added error handling for various failure scenarios
- Implemented markdown rendering for formatting responses

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Testing**: Expand test coverage for critical components
2. **Error Recovery**: Improve handling of PDF processing failures
3. **Performance Optimization**: Reduce memory usage during embedding generation
4. **UX Improvements**: Add loading indicators and better error messages

### Short-term Goals
1. **Incremental Updates**: Support for adding new documents without reprocessing
2. **Response Quality**: Fine-tune context retrieval for more accurate answers
3. **Caching**: Implement response caching for frequently asked questions
4. **User Preferences**: Allow users to customize the interface

### Long-term Considerations
1. **Multiple Model Support**: Allow switching between different local LLMs
2. **Advanced Vector Search**: Implement hybrid search techniques
3. **Document Source Management**: Better handling of multiple document sources
4. **Visualization**: Add visualization for document relationships and context

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architectural Decisions
- **Worker Thread Load Balancing**: Currently using CPU count to determine worker allocation, considering more dynamic allocation based on available memory
- **Vector Store Implementation**: Using HNSWLib for now, evaluating other options for improved performance
- **Embedding Model**: Using Ollama's embeddings for consistency with the generation model

### UX Decisions
- **Interface Simplicity**: Maintaining focus on a clean, minimal interface
- **Response Formatting**: Using markdown for structured responses
- **Context Display**: Currently showing source context on demand, considering better integration

### Technical Considerations
- **Memory Management**: Monitoring memory usage during initial PDF processing
- **Model Consistency**: Ensuring embeddings and generation use consistent models
- **Processing Pipeline**: Optimizing the chunking strategy for better context retention

## Open Questions
- How to handle very large PDF collections efficiently?
- What's the optimal chunk size and overlap for Ableton documentation?
- Should we implement a feedback mechanism for incorrect answers?
- How to handle document updates when new Ableton versions are released?

## Current Environment
- Development on macOS using Node.js and Python
- Testing with Ableton Live 12 Manual PDF
- Using Mistral model via Ollama for local processing
