# Active Context: Ableton Documentation Assistant

## Current Work Focus
The project is currently focused on improving documentation and ensuring consistency across all project materials following the successful upgrade of the technology stack. We've completed a comprehensive README update to accurately reflect the migration from Ollama/Mistral to GPT-4o Local via LocalAI and from HNSWLib to ChromaDB for vector storage. Recent documentation efforts have addressed the specific Python 3.10 requirement for ChromaDB compatibility and the need to use the dedicated `chroma run` command for server startup.

## Recent Changes
- Completed a comprehensive README update with detailed setup instructions
- Added specific instructions for LocalAI GPU acceleration setup in documentation
- Enhanced troubleshooting section with ChromaDB and LocalAI-specific issues
- Updated project structure documentation to reflect ChromaDB integration
- Added explicit notes about Python 3.10 requirement throughout documentation
- Documented the proper startup sequence for all components (ChromaDB, LocalAI, application)
- Successfully implemented LocalAI with GPT-4o model for improved response quality
- Resolved LocalAI configuration issues by properly setting up model paths and configuration files
- Upgraded Node.js to v20 LTS for better performance and security
- Successfully set up ChromaDB with correct Python virtual environment and startup command
- Fixed ChromaDB server startup issues by discovering the proper `chroma run` command for ChromaDB 1.0.7
- Created an executable startup script (start-chromadb.sh) for easier ChromaDB initialization
- Created a new Python 3.10 virtual environment (chromadb_venv) for ChromaDB compatibility
- Fixed authentication errors with LocalAI embeddings by updating model and API key configuration
- Fixed ChromaDB startup issues by moving from Python 3.13 to Python 3.10 environment
- Switched from HNSWLib to ChromaDB for more efficient vector storage and retrieval
- Updated LangChain to the latest version (0.1.9) with modular imports
- Updated import paths in worker.js to support the newer LangChain structure
- Added Node.js engine requirement in package.json to ensure v20+ compatibility
- Discovered and fixed ChromaDB heartbeat issue by using API v2 route instead of v1
- Configured LocalAI with GPU acceleration for improved performance

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Testing**: Continue testing the integration between LocalAI via GPT-4o Local, ChromaDB, and the application
2. **Run Integration Test**: Execute the test-integration.js script to verify all components work together
3. **ChromaDB Optimization**: Tune ChromaDB parameters for optimal performance with Ableton documentation
4. **LocalAI Performance**: Monitor and optimize LocalAI performance with the GPT-4o model
5. **Documentation Consistency**: Ensure all documentation sources stay consistent with recent technology changes

### Short-term Goals
1. **Incremental Updates**: Support for adding new documents without reprocessing
2. **Response Quality**: Fine-tune context retrieval for more accurate answers
3. **Caching**: Implement response caching for frequently asked questions
4. **User Preferences**: Allow users to customize the interface

### Long-term Considerations
1. **Multiple Model Support**: Allow switching between different local LLMs
2. **Advanced Vector Search**: Implement hybrid search techniques
3. **Document Source Management**: Better handling of multiple document sources
4. **Visualization**: Add visualization for document relationships and context

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architectural Decisions
- **Vector Database Choice**: Moved to ChromaDB for better scalability and metadata filtering
- **Embedding Framework**: Using OpenAI compatible endpoints via LocalAI for consistent embeddings
- **LLM Integration**: Using ChatLocalAI for compatibility with the LocalAI server
- **LocalAI Configuration**: Properly configured LocalAI with specific model paths and appropriate settings
- **ChromaDB API Version**: Using API v2 for heartbeat checks and server communication
- **GPU Acceleration**: Enabled GPU acceleration for LocalAI when hardware supports it
- **Documentation Approach**: Comprehensive README with setup, troubleshooting, and architecture information

### UX Decisions
- **Interface Simplicity**: Maintaining focus on a clean, minimal interface
- **Response Formatting**: Using markdown for structured responses
- **Context Display**: Currently showing source context on demand, considering better integration
- **Documentation Clarity**: Ensuring setup instructions are clear and complete for new users

### Technical Considerations
- **LocalAI Requirements**: Monitoring hardware requirements for running GPT-4o locally
- **ChromaDB Server**: Need to ensure ChromaDB server is running before application start
- **Embedding Consistency**: Ensuring embeddings and generation use compatible models
- **Vector Migration**: Plan for migrating existing HNSWLib vectors to ChromaDB format
- **LocalAI Model Path**: Ensuring correct configuration of model paths in LocalAI setup
- **ChromaDB API Compatibility**: Using API v2 for heartbeat to ensure proper server connectivity
- **GPU Acceleration**: Configuring LocalAI to leverage GPU for better performance when available
- **Documentation Maintenance**: Keeping README and other documentation in sync with actual implementation

## Open Questions
- What's the optimal configuration for ChromaDB with our document collection?
- How to handle local setup of multiple dependent services (Node.js, LocalAI, ChromaDB)?
- Should we implement a fallback mechanism if GPT-4o Local is unavailable?
- How to effectively reset/rebuild the ChromaDB collection when needed?
- How can we streamline the installation process for new users?

## Current Environment
- Development on macOS using Node.js v20 LTS
- Testing with Ableton Live 12 Manual PDF
- Using GPT-4o Local via LocalAI (successfully configured) for local processing
- Using ChromaDB for vector storage
