# Active Context: Ableton Documentation Assistant

## Current Work Focus
The project is currently focused on upgrading the technology stack of the Ableton Documentation Assistant to improve performance and response quality. Recent work has involved successfully switching from Ollama with Mistral to GPT-4o Local via LocalAI, upgrading Node.js to v20 LTS, and replacing HNSWLib with ChromaDB for vector storage. We've also fixed compatibility issues with ChromaDB requiring Python 3.10 specifically.

## Recent Changes
- Successfully implemented LocalAI with GPT-4o model for improved response quality
- Resolved LocalAI configuration issues by properly setting up model paths and configuration files
- Upgraded Node.js to v20 LTS for better performance and security
- Successfully set up ChromaDB with correct Python virtual environment and startup command
- Created an executable startup script (start-chromadb.sh) for easier ChromaDB initialization
- Created a new Python 3.10 virtual environment (chromadb_venv) for ChromaDB compatibility
- Fixed authentication errors with LocalAI embeddings by updating model and API key configuration
- Fixed ChromaDB startup issues by moving from Python 3.13 to Python 3.10 environment
- Switched from HNSWLib to ChromaDB for more efficient vector storage and retrieval
- Updated LangChain to the latest version (0.1.9) with modular imports
- Updated import paths in worker.js to support the newer LangChain structure
- Added Node.js engine requirement in package.json to ensure v20+ compatibility

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Testing**: Test the integration between the now-working GPT-4o Local via LocalAI, ChromaDB, and the application
2. **Run Integration Test**: Execute the test-integration.js script to verify all components work together
3. **ChromaDB Optimization**: Tune ChromaDB parameters for optimal performance with Ableton documentation
4. **LocalAI Performance**: Monitor and optimize LocalAI performance with the GPT-4o model
5. **Environment Documentation**: Ensure setup instructions clearly specify Python 3.10 requirement

### Short-term Goals
1. **Incremental Updates**: Support for adding new documents without reprocessing
2. **Response Quality**: Fine-tune context retrieval for more accurate answers
3. **Caching**: Implement response caching for frequently asked questions
4. **User Preferences**: Allow users to customize the interface

### Long-term Considerations
1. **Multiple Model Support**: Allow switching between different local LLMs
2. **Advanced Vector Search**: Implement hybrid search techniques
3. **Document Source Management**: Better handling of multiple document sources
4. **Visualization**: Add visualization for document relationships and context

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architectural Decisions
- **Vector Database Choice**: Moved to ChromaDB for better scalability and metadata filtering
- **Embedding Framework**: Using OpenAI compatible endpoints via LocalAI for consistent embeddings
- **LLM Integration**: Using ChatLocalAI for compatibility with the LocalAI server
- **LocalAI Configuration**: Properly configured LocalAI with specific model paths and appropriate settings

### UX Decisions
- **Interface Simplicity**: Maintaining focus on a clean, minimal interface
- **Response Formatting**: Using markdown for structured responses
- **Context Display**: Currently showing source context on demand, considering better integration

### Technical Considerations
- **LocalAI Requirements**: Monitoring hardware requirements for running GPT-4o locally
- **ChromaDB Server**: Need to ensure ChromaDB server is running before application start
- **Embedding Consistency**: Ensuring embeddings and generation use compatible models
- **Vector Migration**: Plan for migrating existing HNSWLib vectors to ChromaDB format
- **LocalAI Model Path**: Ensuring correct configuration of model paths in LocalAI setup

## Open Questions
- What's the optimal configuration for ChromaDB with our document collection?
- How to handle local setup of multiple dependent services (Node.js, LocalAI, ChromaDB)?
- Should we implement a fallback mechanism if GPT-4o Local is unavailable?
- How to effectively reset/rebuild the ChromaDB collection when needed?

## Current Environment
- Development on macOS using Node.js v20 LTS
- Testing with Ableton Live 12 Manual PDF
- Using GPT-4o Local via LocalAI (successfully configured) for local processing
- Using ChromaDB for vector storage
