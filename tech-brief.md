Ableton Chatbot brief

The application is designed as a chatbot that interrogates a folder filled with pdfs for it's source materials.

It will:
* run locally, using a local LLM
* use a RAG architecture to use the pdfs as its source of truth (located in /pdf)
* use react and mui for its interface
* use whatever LLM or local vector database needed to accomplish this task
